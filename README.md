# My Personal Project
<h2>Emergency Patient Help Center App in Vancouver Area</h2>

<h3> My Personal Information </h3>
  HI THERE! My name is Ziming Ren, you can also call me Rex. This is a personal project from my Computer Science course that I updated and added function for 
  the purpose of development. My user name for school github was 'z0g0i'. Due to the closing of my school github account (which is just because the course ended), I uploaded my code for this project in my personal github account, so any 'z0g0i' you see in the files are me. This project was started from 2024.09.29 and up until 2024.11.29 where I finished the development. This is my first project so hopefully you enjoy it and provide me some feedbacks!
<h3>Purpose of the Application</h3>
This application called "Disability Patient Hellp Center" is designed to provide a convinent, informative,
and helpful tool for people who experience disability or sudden injuries that they can check available hopsitals for their symptoms and call for help. 
<h3>A Sample of the Application</h3>
This application will collect user's patient history, a sample list of needed information for a patient to enter in the app includes
(Number of Patient, Patient's Name, Symptom: *Surgery or Internal*, Description of your symptom, Urgency, Expected Treating Period, Costing $)

**A *Patient Information* list**: (This example is the siutation when a single patient inputs information, it can be multiple)
- Number of Patients: **1**
- Your name: **Ben**
- Your expected treating symptom: **Surgery**
- Description of your current situation: **Broken Arm**
- Urgent or not: **No**
- What is your expected treating period: **Within 7 days**
- Which level of treating fee do you wish to pay: **$10000**.

After collecting these data, then we will provide a list of already existed hospitals that have the ability to collect and treat this patient. For example, a hospital have several basic information

**A *Hospital* Information**:
- Name: **UBC Hospital**
- Treating Symptom: **Mainly Surgery, Minorly Internal**
- Treating period: **Within 3 days**
- Average Cost: **$2000**
- Ambulance for urgency?: **Yes**
- Available Seats for patients: **400**. 

This sample hospital can contain a list of patient that have the above symptom like **Ben** does, when the patient sees various hospitals and choose one of their favourite, they will be added to that hospital's list of patient and they can check their line in that hospital for treating.

<h3>Reason to Create the Application</h3>
Recently, overcrowding in the hospitals around the world have became a serious problem to the medical system. One of the reason is that the government did not create a proper functional pre-treating platform that can let patients to choose where they wanted to be treated and showing the capability of the hospitals. I found that the market is lacking this kind of application. Thus, I wanted to develop this application to help the current medical system to ease the burden from the hospital and provide a better future for the world.
